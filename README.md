# home-floor-plan-hackathon22

As Livspace starts its next ascent by expanding its presence in lower tier cities, we wanted to come up with a plan that gets Livspace more recognition without being too capital intensive.
In small cities across India, construction has been on hyperdrive. These folks want beautiful modern houses but have nowhere to go.
Itâ€™s no longer a problem of capital here as it was maybe a decade ago, just the facility is lacking.
To overcome this problem, we built a service where folks like these can go and get their modern house layout/ design just with few simple clicks.
